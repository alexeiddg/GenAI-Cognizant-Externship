# Personal Finance Tracker

Welcome to the **Personal Finance Tracker** ‚Äî a command-line Python application that helps users track their expenses by category. This tool allows you to record expenses, view all recorded expenses, and see a summary of your spending.

---

## üìå Project Overview

This program simulates a real-world finance tracker. It allows users to:

- Add an expense with a description, category, and amount
- View all recorded expenses grouped by category
- View a summary showing the total amount spent in each category
- Handle invalid inputs gracefully
- Exit the program using a menu-driven interface

Expenses are stored in memory using a Python dictionary, with categories as keys and lists of `(description, amount)` tuples as values.

## üìö Python Concepts Used

This project demonstrates the following key Python programming concepts:

- **Functions**: Code is organized into reusable functions for better modularity and readability.
- **Dictionaries**: Used to store and organize expense data by category.
- **Tuples**: Each individual expense is stored as a tuple `(description, amount)`.
- **Loops**: A `while` loop is used to keep the menu running until the user exits.
- **Conditional Statements**: Used for input validation and menu navigation.
- **Exception Handling**: Gracefully handles invalid numeric input, empty strings, and other runtime errors using `try-except` blocks.
- **User Input Validation**: Ensures the program doesn‚Äôt crash due to unexpected or invalid input.
